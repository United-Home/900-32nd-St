478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/12-0
00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:06.052
Are we recording?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/15-0
00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:09.202
OK.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/17-0
00:00:08.652 --> 00:00:09.892
Yes, we are.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/33-0
00:00:11.172 --> 00:00:15.271
Alright, so I don't know the
names of the rooms. Let me start

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/33-1
00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:17.122
from the back where that is.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/42-0
00:00:31.362 --> 00:00:33.252
OK, so this is the backyard.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/48-0
00:00:34.052 --> 00:00:35.762
And it's all against the street.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/58-0
00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:39.772
That little vehicle. So we park
along the street there.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/71-0
00:00:40.692 --> 00:00:45.642
And we own all the way out until
this area.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/86-0
00:00:47.362 --> 00:00:50.482
Small walk out here. I have no
idea what this used to be and

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/86-1
00:00:50.482 --> 00:00:52.732
might be an old building that
was on there.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/89-0
00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:54.262
Umm yeah.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/103-0
00:01:00.172 --> 00:01:03.410
Is it choppy on your end because
maybe I should record it. It's

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/103-1
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.422
choppy on your side.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/110-0
00:01:06.942 --> 00:01:09.362
And no, it's fine.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/122-0
00:01:10.452 --> 00:01:15.004
OK. And then when you go up
here, I think this is an old

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/122-1
00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:15.882
water well.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/124-0
00:01:17.162 --> 00:01:17.742
OK.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/141-0
00:01:18.452 --> 00:01:22.158
The here on the side, I think
there's a deep water well down

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/141-1
00:01:22.158 --> 00:01:24.892
inside of there and they just
covered it up.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/148-0
00:01:25.402 --> 00:01:26.852
Yeah, it does look like that.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/160-0
00:01:27.952 --> 00:01:32.052
And then this we we own all the
way over to this fence.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/164-0
00:01:32.982 --> 00:01:33.502
Alright.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/211-0
00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:36.313
So what I would like to do
that's my little lawn mower

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/211-1
00:01:36.313 --> 00:01:39.936
there. I'd like to build a
little roof right here and put a

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/211-2
00:01:39.936 --> 00:01:43.559
door on it to protect my lawn
mower so I can lock it up. So

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/191-0
00:01:42.692 --> 00:01:43.002
Umm.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/211-3
00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:47.545
that's this is the existing that
I want you to draw and then also

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/211-4
00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:50.202
put the planned but somehow a
roof on that.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/216-0
00:01:51.482 --> 00:01:53.562
Going out there, you want that?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/225-0
00:01:55.122 --> 00:01:58.142
Here is a clean out system for
the sewer.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/232-0
00:01:59.092 --> 00:02:00.822
So that's a drainage pipe.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/238-0
00:02:02.342 --> 00:02:04.322
This used to probably be a
porch.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/249-0
00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:07.880
Because they have this, they're
probably used to be a door right

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/249-1
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.902
here. Come out so that.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/253-0
00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:10.622
Hmm yeah.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/260-0
00:02:10.402 --> 00:02:13.742
So here is the current
electrical panel.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/271-0
00:02:15.692 --> 00:02:21.022
And the cable system. So this is
100 amps.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/276-0
00:02:21.832 --> 00:02:22.982
This is 100 amps.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/283-0
00:02:23.762 --> 00:02:26.112
And then there are also broken
up 100 a 100.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/312-0
00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:30.582
And then over here on the side,
that's like for Internet for

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/312-1
00:02:30.582 --> 00:02:34.355
telephone. So those three boxes,
they can be gone, we don't need

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/312-2
00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:38.012
them at all, they can just get
ripped off because they're old.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/320-0
00:02:39.882 --> 00:02:42.922
OK. And then if you look inside
of here?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/327-0
00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:46.462
That's what it looks like right
now inside.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/332-0
00:02:52.312 --> 00:02:52.962
Gosh, it's.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/339-0
00:02:53.082 --> 00:02:56.892
Ohh OK this one inside.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/355-0
00:03:05.672 --> 00:03:09.226
So the weather controlled, they
have a master switch here

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/355-1
00:03:09.226 --> 00:03:10.942
underneath that's turned on.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/364-0
00:03:12.242 --> 00:03:16.232
You're right, it's a D it's a
gas.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/375-0
00:03:17.252 --> 00:03:19.432
No, that's electric this is.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/374-0
00:03:18.172 --> 00:03:19.382
Go ohh.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/430-0
00:03:20.212 --> 00:03:23.562
This is the on off switch for
this box, and then there's an

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/386-0
00:03:23.012 --> 00:03:23.862
Oh, right.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/430-1
00:03:23.562 --> 00:03:27.135
off switch here for this box and
there's no bubble on this one,

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/430-2
00:03:27.135 --> 00:03:30.652
so this one doesn't work. I just
called on Monday. They should

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/395-0
00:03:27.612 --> 00:03:27.842
Right.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/430-3
00:03:30.652 --> 00:03:33.835
come out and give me the
approval to turn that on. So we

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/430-4
00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:37.352
only have one right now. So half
the power in the house works.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/432-0
00:03:39.032 --> 00:03:39.342
Right.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/439-0
00:03:39.222 --> 00:03:41.712
OK, you have a basement down
there.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/451-0
00:03:43.092 --> 00:03:47.412
And so all these wires come in
that go down into the basement.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/462-0
00:03:48.262 --> 00:03:52.832
So take you down there. Ohh,
come on. He locked it up.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/474-0
00:04:26.602 --> 00:04:27.622
OK so.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/507-0
00:04:31.132 --> 00:04:35.037
Then all those wires that you
saw, they come in from this

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/507-1
00:04:35.037 --> 00:04:39.279
boxes. No, on all on the top,
back to the back. Then they sell

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/507-2
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.242
the house. So he boxes. That's
all for now.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/506-0
00:04:40.132 --> 00:04:42.222
Your video is stuck.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/514-0
00:04:42.942 --> 00:04:44.122
Hey your video stuff.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/519-0
00:04:45.562 --> 00:04:47.832
Your videos stuck.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/522-0
00:04:49.932 --> 00:04:50.562
How about now?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/526-0
00:04:52.682 --> 00:04:54.092
Yeah, yeah, it would sound.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/528-0
00:04:55.312 --> 00:04:55.782
OK.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/557-0
00:04:57.742 --> 00:05:02.272
So all these wires. So I came
down the basement. All the wires

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/557-1
00:05:02.272 --> 00:05:06.514
come in there, they come back
along here. One of them is a

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/557-2
00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:10.612
little on off switch for the
furnace. That's right here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/562-0
00:05:11.612 --> 00:05:13.332
You have two.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/568-0
00:05:14.902 --> 00:05:16.362
Hot water heaters over there.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/577-0
00:05:17.292 --> 00:05:20.492
And then this pipe here. I know
it's dark.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/600-0
00:05:21.152 --> 00:05:25.362
That that pipe is for gas, so
that gas pipe goes all the way

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/600-1
00:05:25.362 --> 00:05:29.711
back through the whole property
straight back there, the water

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/600-2
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:31.782
comes from way back there too.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/605-0
00:05:33.342 --> 00:05:34.432
And my door is closing.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/611-0
00:05:35.342 --> 00:05:37.012
Yeah. The water comes from way
back to there.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/616-0
00:05:37.732 --> 00:05:39.372
And then back here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/625-0
00:05:40.402 --> 00:05:43.892
There's an on a big valve that I
can turn for the water.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/630-0
00:05:45.402 --> 00:05:47.112
And then over here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/650-0
00:05:47.932 --> 00:05:51.419
You can see where the water pipe
is, so the water comes in and it

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/650-1
00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.748
comes out. There's four and we
have off valves for all four of

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/650-2
00:05:54.748 --> 00:05:55.012
them.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/652-0
00:05:56.632 --> 00:05:57.502
OK.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/665-0
00:05:58.972 --> 00:06:02.526
So that and then we have this
shelf over here that has a lot

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/665-1
00:06:02.526 --> 00:06:03.342
of junk on it.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/680-0
00:06:05.572 --> 00:06:11.251
And on this side, we're going to
put a dryer here and a washer

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/680-1
00:06:11.251 --> 00:06:11.702
here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/682-0
00:06:13.572 --> 00:06:13.902
Click.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/690-0
00:06:17.562 --> 00:06:19.652
How are going back up to the
real world?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/699-0
00:06:22.622 --> 00:06:27.252
OK, let's go inside. Show you
that part.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/702-0
00:06:31.472 --> 00:06:32.142
I'm recording.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/714-0
00:06:35.632 --> 00:06:40.252
OK, so this is a room you have
an outlet here in the corner.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/720-0
00:06:41.422 --> 00:06:44.352
Have an outlet over there.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/731-0
00:06:45.172 --> 00:06:48.242
But just a blank spot there. A
hole in the wall here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/736-0
00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:50.032
I don't know why there's a hole
in the wall.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/740-0
00:06:51.352 --> 00:06:52.632
Another outlet there.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/752-0
00:06:55.102 --> 00:06:57.632
I think it's gonna be an hour.
Wires are just hanging out now.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/755-0
00:06:58.482 --> 00:06:59.372
Yeah.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/757-0
00:07:00.082 --> 00:07:00.652
OK.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/762-0
00:07:01.482 --> 00:07:03.112
So that's this side over here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/770-0
00:07:04.522 --> 00:07:08.072
Just the front room. That's
where the heater comes in.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/774-0
00:07:10.312 --> 00:07:11.682
That's called the.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/781-0
00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:13.822
Intake it takes.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/780-0
00:07:12.972 --> 00:07:13.802
Congratulation.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/788-0
00:07:14.632 --> 00:07:16.472
This takes ear back to the
heater.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/795-0
00:07:17.952 --> 00:07:18.912
It doesn't Kick It Out.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/798-0
00:07:18.012 --> 00:07:20.162
And that might be the wind.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/804-0
00:07:21.912 --> 00:07:23.242
So here is another heater.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/821-0
00:07:24.812 --> 00:07:27.743
So I showed you a heater down in
the basement, so this is a

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/821-1
00:07:27.743 --> 00:07:30.382
secondary heater. AS2 heater
systems in the property.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/827-0
00:07:31.722 --> 00:07:34.632
And then here is a little
kitchen.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/836-0
00:07:35.812 --> 00:07:38.571
We need to upgrade that toilet
over there, put a brand new one

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/836-1
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:38.702
in.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/838-0
00:07:41.152 --> 00:07:41.852
And.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/857-0
00:07:43.252 --> 00:07:45.477
Not sure how much work this
whole bathroom needs. It's just

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/857-1
00:07:45.477 --> 00:07:47.666
dark in there. I don't really
wanna go in there right now.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/857-2
00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:48.222
It's just dark.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/872-0
00:07:49.522 --> 00:07:53.242
And then we just pull this thing
out yesterday. So it has a

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/872-1
00:07:53.242 --> 00:07:55.102
little tiny kitchen area here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/885-0
00:07:56.092 --> 00:08:00.823
For some calmness above it, that
thing usually goes back and that

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/885-1
00:08:00.823 --> 00:08:01.182
wall.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/898-0
00:08:02.342 --> 00:08:05.838
Looking back into the back of
the property, they have these

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/898-1
00:08:05.838 --> 00:08:06.712
counts up here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/915-0
00:08:07.472 --> 00:08:10.775
And probably needs a new kitchen
design. Eventually they'll

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/915-1
00:08:10.775 --> 00:08:13.362
probably be in like 20 to 184
new design here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/926-0
00:08:15.172 --> 00:08:17.698
Alright, now I'm going to take
you guys upstairs, so we have

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/926-1
00:08:17.698 --> 00:08:18.982
some stairs that were going up.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/930-0
00:08:21.922 --> 00:08:22.882
Living up here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/939-0
00:08:25.832 --> 00:08:28.135
He's the only renter of the
whole house. He's the king of

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/939-1
00:08:28.135 --> 00:08:28.532
the house.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/943-0
00:08:32.182 --> 00:08:33.222
Any Kitty came to me.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/951-0
00:08:35.072 --> 00:08:35.872
I don't see him.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/954-0
00:08:35.322 --> 00:08:38.212
There's something on your
camera. Is that your finger?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/964-0
00:08:39.162 --> 00:08:42.962
Yes. Come on, man. Alright,
fine. Are you the other hand?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/978-0
00:08:44.712 --> 00:08:49.352
OK, so this is like the attic.
You could see how it curves.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/980-0
00:08:49.912 --> 00:08:50.712
Yeah.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/988-0
00:08:51.542 --> 00:08:54.912
OK, so you need to draw that in
for this bedroom.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/994-0
00:08:55.892 --> 00:08:57.592
There's a hole in the wall that
he's patched.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1008-0
00:08:59.162 --> 00:09:01.734
And that's like a little
cubbyhole where we can look back

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1008-1
00:09:01.734 --> 00:09:03.862
and see the attic in there.
That's pretty cool.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1011-0
00:09:04.742 --> 00:09:05.152
Umm.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1012-0
00:09:04.892 --> 00:09:05.372
Ohh.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1023-0
00:09:07.042 --> 00:09:10.482
We did put a new outlet in over
here already on this side.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1028-0
00:09:11.592 --> 00:09:12.862
As USB in it.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1033-0
00:09:15.402 --> 00:09:16.822
That's just a little closet.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1058-0
00:09:19.152 --> 00:09:22.988
Definitely needs new either new
carpet or hardwood floor. Maybe

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1058-1
00:09:22.988 --> 00:09:26.703
underneath all of this there's
hardwood floor. I personally I

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1058-2
00:09:26.703 --> 00:09:27.962
love hardwood floors.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1060-0
00:09:28.622 --> 00:09:29.232
Me too.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1062-0
00:09:30.412 --> 00:09:30.722
Umm.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1074-0
00:09:30.772 --> 00:09:34.592
Sometimes we can pick this stuff
up. No, that's not hard work.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1079-0
00:09:35.322 --> 00:09:36.452
Well, I don't know what it is.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1085-0
00:09:38.262 --> 00:09:39.442
Maybe that's for another day.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1096-0
00:09:41.292 --> 00:09:45.071
OK, there is a leak right now.
This is where the leak is

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1096-1
00:09:45.071 --> 00:09:45.602
showing.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1109-0
00:09:47.002 --> 00:09:50.196
And it's not coming through that
hole in the attic. So here's

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1109-1
00:09:50.196 --> 00:09:52.102
another little bedroom on this
side.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1126-0
00:09:59.022 --> 00:10:02.238
There's also a leak over inside
of that. That's just a closet

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1126-1
00:10:02.238 --> 00:10:04.002
over there. There's a leak in
it.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1148-0
00:10:06.282 --> 00:10:09.893
OK, I think that's all on this
side. So it's set up like a

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1148-1
00:10:09.893 --> 00:10:13.688
duplex. So I have to go back
downstairs and I cross over into

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1148-2
00:10:13.688 --> 00:10:15.402
the other side of the house.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1152-0
00:10:16.602 --> 00:10:17.822
A duplex means it.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1157-0
00:10:24.562 --> 00:10:24.862
OK.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1159-0
00:10:25.232 --> 00:10:25.572
OK.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1190-0
00:10:26.752 --> 00:10:29.849
So that's that on this whole
side, you can see the hole in

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1190-1
00:10:29.849 --> 00:10:33.052
the wall. I don't know why they
put the whole wall, but that

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1190-2
00:10:33.052 --> 00:10:36.149
gets to the other side of the
property. I could just crawl

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1190-3
00:10:36.149 --> 00:10:38.722
through there. Let's do it.
Let's crawl through.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1195-0
00:10:39.082 --> 00:10:41.362
Can you do that? Even that a
small hole?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1200-0
00:10:43.902 --> 00:10:45.662
I'm here. I'm eight it.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1205-0
00:10:46.262 --> 00:10:47.422
Hmm.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1203-0
00:10:46.762 --> 00:10:47.262
Umm.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1211-0
00:10:48.572 --> 00:10:50.382
OK, so now we have this side.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1229-0
00:10:55.942 --> 00:11:00.115
And we have a leak over here.
All of that just fell down like

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1229-1
00:11:00.115 --> 00:11:01.192
three weeks ago.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1238-0
00:11:01.982 --> 00:11:04.745
Because there's water damage,
there's water coming in through

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1238-1
00:11:04.745 --> 00:11:05.012
there.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1256-0
00:11:06.052 --> 00:11:09.772
And that same water is coming in
through here. So that room I

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1256-1
00:11:09.772 --> 00:11:12.292
showed you as above with closet,
I think.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1257-0
00:11:17.832 --> 00:11:18.402
Ohh.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1263-0
00:11:18.812 --> 00:11:19.602
This is gonna.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1267-0
00:11:19.232 --> 00:11:20.752
That's causing a seepage.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1270-0
00:11:21.162 --> 00:11:21.392
We.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1278-0
00:11:23.052 --> 00:11:24.812
Yeah. We just pulled out this
little.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1311-0
00:11:25.842 --> 00:11:29.690
Stove just to see the electric
behind it all this electric

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1311-1
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.408
needs to be upgraded to a
lecture there GFCI outlets, so

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1311-2
00:11:33.408 --> 00:11:37.452
you guys should learn what GFCI
outlets are already. Have all

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1311-3
00:11:37.452 --> 00:11:38.952
the outlets right here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1340-0
00:11:40.232 --> 00:11:45.180
That's GFCI, and they also all
need to have this little line on

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1340-1
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.820
this side. If it doesn't have
that line sideways, then it's

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1340-2
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.222
not 20 amps, so you'll see
written on here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1342-0
00:11:57.012 --> 00:11:58.012
20.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1347-0
00:11:59.072 --> 00:12:01.152
That means it's 20 amps.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1374-0
00:12:02.792 --> 00:12:06.430
OK, so all of them that we did
have that little line on the

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1374-1
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.251
side, it's two up and down and
I'll line on the side. I called

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1374-2
00:12:10.251 --> 00:12:11.282
them Chinese men.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1376-0
00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:13.902
Mm-hmm.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1386-0
00:12:14.992 --> 00:12:17.742
So this is an old one that's the
old style.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1380-0
00:12:15.032 --> 00:12:15.562
Yeah.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1408-0
00:12:18.652 --> 00:12:22.412
And he needs taken out for two
reasons. For one, he doesn't

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1408-1
00:12:22.412 --> 00:12:25.984
have the little line on the
side, but also anywhere that

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1408-2
00:12:25.984 --> 00:12:26.862
water can get.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1415-0
00:12:27.932 --> 00:12:29.782
You need these buttons in the
middle.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1460-0
00:12:33.832 --> 00:12:38.233
So obviously sync a water can
get there, so he needs to have

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1428-0
00:12:38.082 --> 00:12:38.422
You.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1460-1
00:12:38.233 --> 00:12:42.346
the GFCI. The little buttons on
it anywhere in the whole

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1439-0
00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:41.352
Alright.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1460-2
00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:47.035
kitchen, anywhere within 12 feet
of water needs to have GFCI. So

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1460-3
00:12:47.035 --> 00:12:49.272
that one needs changed as well.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1487-0
00:12:50.902 --> 00:12:54.677
This is a connection that
actually has gas coming up here,

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1487-1
00:12:54.677 --> 00:12:58.324
and it has electric coming up
here, so we can use gas or

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1487-2
00:12:58.324 --> 00:13:01.012
electric stove in this area I
wanna keep.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1516-0
00:13:02.672 --> 00:13:06.266
Electric for now. Just put that
back in there, but keep that in

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1516-1
00:13:06.266 --> 00:13:09.805
mind that we could put gas over
there and have it in your map.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1516-2
00:13:09.805 --> 00:13:13.006
This is a little laundry area,
kind of interesting. It's

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1516-3
00:13:13.006 --> 00:13:14.242
underneath the stairs.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1564-0
00:13:15.122 --> 00:13:19.415
And that that side is made for
the dryer, I guess. Yeah. And I

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1523-0
00:13:15.602 --> 00:13:16.482
Yeah, right.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1564-1
00:13:19.415 --> 00:13:23.504
think that little thing there
that's probably the vent they

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1564-2
00:13:23.504 --> 00:13:27.661
probably have that covered up as
a vent. And then here's the

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1554-0
00:13:26.952 --> 00:13:27.542
Wrong.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1564-3
00:13:27.661 --> 00:13:30.932
water coming up for the washer
and this corner.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1591-0
00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:37.168
These are the pipes behind the
shower, so they put little

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1591-1
00:13:37.168 --> 00:13:40.921
access panels like this behind a
shower. So if I take you back

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1591-2
00:13:40.921 --> 00:13:43.662
inside the bathroom at this side
of property.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1597-0
00:13:45.112 --> 00:13:46.432
You can see it back there.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1639-0
00:13:47.032 --> 00:13:50.885
And there's a shower back there,
so you have the access panels

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1639-1
00:13:50.885 --> 00:13:54.861
over there, and then the actual
shower on the side. They do that

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1639-2
00:13:54.861 --> 00:13:58.836
quite often, very tiny bathroom.
Again, we don't have the lights

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1639-3
00:13:58.836 --> 00:14:01.772
on. And again, I have some roof
damage up here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1645-0
00:14:02.382 --> 00:14:04.022
Because we have that water leak.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1656-0
00:14:04.682 --> 00:14:08.042
Now, if Hadijah actually their
job and got me a roofer.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1674-0
00:14:08.782 --> 00:14:11.872
My property wouldn't be falling
in like this. This didn't exist

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1683-0
00:14:11.352 --> 00:14:14.962
Do you have all the pictures of
the roof damage on this

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1674-1
00:14:11.872 --> 00:14:12.162
among.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1683-1
00:14:14.962 --> 00:14:15.542
property?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1699-0
00:14:16.302 --> 00:14:19.633
Dude, I'm giving it to you right
now this very minute. This is

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1698-0
00:14:19.582 --> 00:14:20.042
Ah.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1699-1
00:14:19.633 --> 00:14:19.792
it.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1702-0
00:14:20.622 --> 00:14:21.402
Fix this.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1715-0
00:14:23.002 --> 00:14:26.872
This this and hire me a roofer.
It's not complex.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1759-0
00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:31.923
Alright, but you know, uh no.
The roofers I talked to, they

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1719-0
00:14:27.702 --> 00:14:28.402
Yeah.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1759-1
00:14:31.923 --> 00:14:36.281
will do the whole roof repair.
They won't do the patches I

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1759-2
00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:40.934
talked to like three of them and
all of them said we won't do,

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1759-3
00:14:40.934 --> 00:14:43.002
just patch it. We will just.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1765-0
00:14:41.382 --> 00:14:44.921
What? Ask them the price if the
price is cheap, I'm cool with

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1765-1
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:45.092
it.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1772-0
00:14:45.782 --> 00:14:46.982
OK, so anyway, this is another.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1776-0
00:14:46.242 --> 00:14:48.232
And OK.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1780-0
00:14:48.752 --> 00:14:49.962
Other room.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1822-0
00:14:51.392 --> 00:14:55.030
So kind of giving you a view. If
there's this room that we came

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1822-1
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:58.384
through, remember we came
through the hole in the wall. We

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1822-2
00:14:58.384 --> 00:15:01.795
went in the kitchen, we went in
the bathroom, tons of water

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1822-3
00:15:01.795 --> 00:15:05.150
damage all in this area of the
house. All three rooms have

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1822-4
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:06.912
water damage because of hadija.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1862-0
00:15:09.332 --> 00:15:13.705
And then we have a door going
outside hadija. Also, she wants

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1862-1
00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:18.077
me to die because we have no
column here, so they're supposed

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1862-2
00:15:18.077 --> 00:15:21.886
to be a column, just like
there's a column here and a

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1862-3
00:15:21.886 --> 00:15:22.732
column here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1866-0
00:15:22.112 --> 00:15:24.272
But there's no call him in the
house.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1883-0
00:15:25.122 --> 00:15:28.892
Yeah, there's no column. Look at
that. No column. You just.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1889-0
00:15:27.062 --> 00:15:30.342
Hello how is this still
stunning?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1900-0
00:15:30.532 --> 00:15:33.637
She just wants me to die. She's
just waiting to see me

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1900-1
00:15:33.637 --> 00:15:34.202
flattened.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1912-0
00:15:37.832 --> 00:15:41.018
So she needs to figure out how
tall this one is and get a

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1912-1
00:15:41.018 --> 00:15:42.062
replacement for it.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1920-0
00:15:43.562 --> 00:15:44.762
Yep, that's her job.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1923-0
00:15:43.802 --> 00:15:45.082
Can you make it for me?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1928-0
00:15:45.642 --> 00:15:47.832
I'm busy. I'm busy filming right
now.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1930-0
00:15:48.312 --> 00:15:48.912
Alright.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1939-0
00:15:50.712 --> 00:15:53.442
OK. So we're going back in. We
have this room.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1966-0
00:15:54.432 --> 00:15:57.709
Umm, we eventually need somebody
to like sand and gloss the

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1966-1
00:15:57.709 --> 00:16:01.151
hardwood floors. I think these
are original hardwood floors. I

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1966-2
00:16:01.151 --> 00:16:03.882
think they will look gorgeous
once you send them.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1970-0
00:16:04.332 --> 00:16:05.442
Yeah, they will.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1989-0
00:16:05.972 --> 00:16:09.699
We need somebody for the plaster
walls. We have little spots like

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1989-1
00:16:09.699 --> 00:16:12.861
this and I don't know what they
did. They had the nails

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1989-2
00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:13.482
everywhere.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/1996-0
00:16:14.622 --> 00:16:16.042
Now that is cool.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2006-0
00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:18.082
That's a lot of nails.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2001-0
00:16:16.862 --> 00:16:17.122
And.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2017-0
00:16:18.462 --> 00:16:22.582
Have little spots like this in
the wall, so this stuff is

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2017-1
00:16:22.582 --> 00:16:23.932
called plaster PLA.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2036-0
00:16:27.752 --> 00:16:31.648
Faster, so you need a new
plaster artist to come in and

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2036-1
00:16:31.648 --> 00:16:35.822
fix all of that up. I want every
single hole gone in there.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2048-0
00:16:36.882 --> 00:16:40.262
Fixed. We might train like wasfa
how to do that.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2051-0
00:16:41.082 --> 00:16:41.692
Who knows?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2082-0
00:16:45.232 --> 00:16:49.051
It's not really hard work. OK,
so then there's a another poor

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2082-1
00:16:49.051 --> 00:16:52.747
child here. Now, this is the
port that I showed you before.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2082-2
00:16:52.747 --> 00:16:55.642
In the photos that this roof
came and fell in.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2087-0
00:16:58.002 --> 00:16:58.392
I need.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2112-0
00:16:58.032 --> 00:17:00.629
And you have to see why all of
the roots are falling in. I

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2112-1
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:03.357
mean, we buy these properties
super cheap and this is what we

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2112-2
00:17:03.357 --> 00:17:05.382
do. We buy them and we fix this
kind of crap.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2114-0
00:17:06.962 --> 00:17:07.272
Right.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2124-0
00:17:08.192 --> 00:17:10.142
But at least this one has the
pole.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2122-0
00:17:08.842 --> 00:17:09.342
What?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2126-0
00:17:11.942 --> 00:17:12.532
Yep.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2134-0
00:17:15.862 --> 00:17:19.672
OK, so that's that. I'm gonna go
upstairs here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2150-0
00:17:22.262 --> 00:17:25.439
So that has like stairs that
curve around. It's just takes

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2150-1
00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:28.832
you up and shows you where that
water damage is starting from.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2159-0
00:17:31.312 --> 00:17:35.482
OK, so the water damage is
starting.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2165-0
00:17:36.782 --> 00:17:38.992
From up there in the attic.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2173-0
00:17:39.692 --> 00:17:42.022
And I did put some buckets up
there.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2178-0
00:17:43.032 --> 00:17:44.602
Just temporarily.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2183-0
00:17:46.102 --> 00:17:48.112
Let's keep on climbing.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2192-0
00:17:49.302 --> 00:17:51.852
I'll look at them. My bucket
fell over.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2194-0
00:17:52.332 --> 00:17:52.822
Ohh.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2198-0
00:17:54.952 --> 00:17:56.482
So I have a few.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2204-0
00:17:57.342 --> 00:17:58.022
But it's.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2205-0
00:17:57.392 --> 00:17:58.342
Buckets here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2215-0
00:17:59.502 --> 00:18:02.212
And there's a whole look at
that. Just a hole in the roof.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2226-0
00:18:03.532 --> 00:18:05.942
But actually the water is coming
in from right here. I don't know

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2226-1
00:18:05.942 --> 00:18:06.782
if you guys can see it.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2234-0
00:18:07.592 --> 00:18:09.842
Our son, there's a hole over
there.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2251-0
00:18:11.192 --> 00:18:14.853
But if that guy wants to change
out the whole roof, whatever,

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2251-1
00:18:14.853 --> 00:18:16.742
man he can do, he can go for it.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2259-0
00:18:17.392 --> 00:18:18.802
That is better be a cheap price.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2258-0
00:18:17.622 --> 00:18:18.242
Yeah, yeah.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2261-0
00:18:19.752 --> 00:18:20.152
Yeah.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2268-0
00:18:21.002 --> 00:18:22.842
Got a cool, cute little window
over there.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2292-0
00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:27.361
I want to put flooring down here
so I can actually walk up here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2292-1
00:18:27.361 --> 00:18:30.711
The ceilings kinda hot. We could
use this for something if we put

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2292-2
00:18:30.711 --> 00:18:31.472
flooring in it.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2293-0
00:18:31.272 --> 00:18:31.662
Yeah.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2319-0
00:18:32.172 --> 00:18:33.002
Network number.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2299-0
00:18:32.842 --> 00:18:34.392
And that thing? You got it
right.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2303-0
00:18:35.132 --> 00:18:35.982
That's really bad.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2309-0
00:18:36.472 --> 00:18:37.512
Yeah, it's pretty big.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2310-0
00:18:37.502 --> 00:18:38.072
Yeah.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2316-0
00:18:38.392 --> 00:18:40.712
OK, I'm going. I'm going back
down. It's gonna be a.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2388-0
00:18:44.602 --> 00:18:46.252
So you can use polythene.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2323-0
00:18:45.622 --> 00:18:46.422
I think Aleem.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2392-0
00:18:47.412 --> 00:18:48.332
But for.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2326-0
00:18:47.862 --> 00:18:48.292
Yeah.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2336-0
00:18:50.312 --> 00:18:51.832
That the the you need my help.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2337-0
00:18:51.022 --> 00:18:52.082
I can hear you, Hammad girl.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2345-0
00:18:53.082 --> 00:18:53.472
What?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2346-0
00:18:54.652 --> 00:18:56.532
You're really quite Hammad, say
that again.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2395-0
00:18:54.732 --> 00:18:54.962
Yeah.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2412-0
00:18:56.352 --> 00:19:00.935
Yet yes, I'm saying you you can
use policy for a temporary

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2412-1
00:19:00.935 --> 00:19:01.712
treatment.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2416-0
00:19:02.752 --> 00:19:03.642
For this hole.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2353-0
00:19:05.092 --> 00:19:06.422
Tell you I can't hear you at
all.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2360-0
00:19:07.372 --> 00:19:08.462
My mic.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2422-0
00:19:07.482 --> 00:19:08.802
Can you hear me now, Sir?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2366-0
00:19:07.942 --> 00:19:10.712
I'm old. You gotta you gotta
yell, dude.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2373-0
00:19:12.202 --> 00:19:14.492
You are far from your mic.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2428-0
00:19:12.422 --> 00:19:13.742
Sir, I'm saying that.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2454-0
00:19:14.972 --> 00:19:19.274
You need uh, you can, you can
use uh polythene sheet for a

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2454-1
00:19:19.274 --> 00:19:21.972
temporary treatment for these
leads.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2385-0
00:19:24.452 --> 00:19:28.427
So I don't know polytene
treatment. Just write it down so

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2457-0
00:19:27.722 --> 00:19:27.932
What?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2385-1
00:19:28.427 --> 00:19:29.592
that people know.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2464-0
00:19:29.162 --> 00:19:30.602
For the team sheet, OK.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2417-0
00:19:32.042 --> 00:19:34.252
Write it on a chat please.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2475-0
00:19:33.962 --> 00:19:36.789
OK, so we need the walls
painted. Looks like somebody

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2475-1
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:39.930
started, but they're lazy and
they didn't do it. Looks like

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2475-2
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.972
they didn't do a very good job
anyway.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2484-0
00:19:42.752 --> 00:19:45.242
So need all the walls painted.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2478-0
00:19:42.812 --> 00:19:43.322
No.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2504-0
00:19:46.442 --> 00:19:49.277
The electric we have an
appointment to turn the electric

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2504-1
00:19:49.277 --> 00:19:52.212
on Monday, so we will see you on
Monday. That stuff works.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2523-0
00:19:53.902 --> 00:19:57.936
Again, it has a hard floor. This
is called distressed. Distressed

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2523-1
00:19:57.936 --> 00:20:00.992
means it hasn't been treated
well. So we need to.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2551-0
00:20:01.732 --> 00:20:05.602
Yeah. Figure out why and sand
it. It does not look like

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2551-1
00:20:05.602 --> 00:20:09.887
there's a leakage in this side,
except that one corner there,

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2551-2
00:20:09.887 --> 00:20:11.822
which we already knew about.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2563-0
00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:16.262
So, but that is gonna damage the
wood right here, unless we.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2568-0
00:20:17.282 --> 00:20:19.142
Mitigate that rather quickly.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2587-0
00:20:20.922 --> 00:20:24.740
And that's just whenever Hadijah
decides to finally get us a

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2587-1
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.432
contractor. We got plenty of
money for it.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2599-0
00:20:29.912 --> 00:20:33.172
Ohh, I'd like those lamps. Why
are they lying on the floor man?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2601-0
00:20:31.042 --> 00:20:32.912
Yeah, yeah.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2618-0
00:20:33.632 --> 00:20:36.013
I like him too. That's why I
bought them. I just didn't have

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2618-1
00:20:36.013 --> 00:20:38.472
anywhere to put them. I like the
photo too. The photo is cute.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2628-0
00:20:39.022 --> 00:20:41.352
Yeah. For this I like the frame
of the photo.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2638-0
00:20:42.182 --> 00:20:45.932
Yeah, me too. But I didn't have
a place to hang it.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2645-0
00:20:48.022 --> 00:20:48.822
It's cool.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2644-0
00:20:48.172 --> 00:20:48.592
That's.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2667-0
00:20:53.542 --> 00:20:56.979
OK. So yeah, I like this room.
It has a good vibe. It's gonna

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2667-1
00:20:56.979 --> 00:21:00.526
be nice. And there's actually a
fireplace back behind this wall

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2667-2
00:21:00.526 --> 00:21:01.912
so you can see where the.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2679-0
00:21:04.532 --> 00:21:08.186
So I think it would be nice to
rip that back down and bring the

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2679-1
00:21:08.186 --> 00:21:09.042
fireplace back.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2692-0
00:21:09.742 --> 00:21:14.831
Maybe like a the bed over on
that wall with a little

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2692-1
00:21:14.831 --> 00:21:16.272
fireplace here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2702-0
00:21:17.012 --> 00:21:20.712
I don't know, or even a bed up
against the window coming out.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2709-0
00:21:21.432 --> 00:21:24.282
TV above your fireplace, little
fireplace.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2729-0
00:21:26.112 --> 00:21:30.477
OK, so there's no there's no
bathroom much up here, which I

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2713-0
00:21:26.262 --> 00:21:26.652
Yeah.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2729-1
00:21:30.477 --> 00:21:34.552
don't like. There is this little
tiny cubby I lost you.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2742-0
00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:37.822
There is this little cubby. It
looks like they had it for,

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2742-1
00:21:37.822 --> 00:21:39.422
like, a little kid closet or
something.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2760-0
00:21:40.162 --> 00:21:43.549
And I'd like to remodel this.
Maybe it's gonna be 1/2 bath

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2750-0
00:21:40.522 --> 00:21:41.022
Right.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2760-1
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:45.272
like just a toilet and a sink.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2762-0
00:21:46.182 --> 00:21:46.492
I.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2782-0
00:21:47.282 --> 00:21:50.157
Yeah, I'm not sure what you want
to put on there, but you at

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2782-1
00:21:50.157 --> 00:21:53.126
least kind of see the dimensions
of that place and see how the

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2782-2
00:21:53.126 --> 00:21:54.352
doors all kind of connect.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2828-0
00:21:55.142 --> 00:21:58.564
And that's it. And we just
constantly get more and more

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2828-1
00:21:58.564 --> 00:22:02.292
damage to this property since
we're not fixing the roof, the

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2828-2
00:22:02.292 --> 00:22:05.836
lack of fixing the roof is
turning this into a really bad

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2828-3
00:22:05.836 --> 00:22:09.686
property. So that needs to be
addressed before really anything

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2828-4
00:22:09.686 --> 00:22:09.992
else.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2830-0
00:22:12.372 --> 00:22:12.852
And.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2847-0
00:22:13.642 --> 00:22:17.469
I taught hadijah how to get a
roofer, but she just doesn't

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2847-1
00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:20.972
really care. She wants her
property. Just keep dying.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2873-0
00:22:22.182 --> 00:22:27.063
No, now I know the proper method
to do it, so this time I will do

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2873-1
00:22:27.063 --> 00:22:29.652
it better and with your
approvals.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2881-0
00:22:27.762 --> 00:22:31.418
You could either please tire
room for for this property. This

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2881-1
00:22:31.418 --> 00:22:32.892
is my one of my favorite.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2902-0
00:22:35.132 --> 00:22:38.312
The thing is, time doesn't wait.
We can have all excuse in the

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2902-1
00:22:38.312 --> 00:22:41.592
world, but at the end of the day
it's gonna rain. It's gonna get

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2902-2
00:22:41.592 --> 00:22:42.602
wet. It's gonna die.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2904-0
00:22:44.152 --> 00:22:44.692
Yeah.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2912-0
00:22:46.452 --> 00:22:48.832
OK, so I just want to show you
the outside of the building.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2916-0
00:22:50.422 --> 00:22:51.832
Oh cool.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2922-0
00:22:53.172 --> 00:22:54.852
Outside is very pretty.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2931-0
00:22:55.522 --> 00:22:56.612
The sky is cool.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2977-0
00:22:55.672 --> 00:22:59.052
We've done a lot of work, we've
done a lot of work on the

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2977-1
00:22:59.052 --> 00:23:02.258
outside so far. I know it still
has issues. We have no

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2977-2
00:23:02.258 --> 00:23:05.755
landscaping, no orders. We even
thought of putting a little

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2977-3
00:23:05.755 --> 00:23:09.077
fence up around the property
with vines growing on it. I

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2977-4
00:23:09.077 --> 00:23:12.749
trimmed this tree up a lot of
the tree was touching the ground

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2977-5
00:23:12.749 --> 00:23:15.022
before, so now you can see
underneath.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/2986-0
00:23:15.892 --> 00:23:18.382
And we still need to clean up a
lot of the weeds along here.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3001-0
00:23:19.812 --> 00:23:23.321
But it's coming along. It's
starting to look like a nice

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3001-1
00:23:23.321 --> 00:23:24.922
addition to the community.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3003-0
00:23:27.002 --> 00:23:27.322
Well.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3018-0
00:23:35.512 --> 00:23:39.632
That's a corner house. That's
why is has like 2 entries.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3011-0
00:23:35.712 --> 00:23:36.532
OK.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3022-0
00:23:40.802 --> 00:23:41.932
Uh, three entries.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3031-0
00:23:42.652 --> 00:23:43.392
Yeah, I'm sorry.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3032-0
00:23:42.832 --> 00:23:44.182
Because in the back too.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3037-0
00:23:45.992 --> 00:23:47.272
I'm going to go across the
street.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3041-0
00:23:49.892 --> 00:23:51.112
Just so you could see more of
it.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3051-0
00:23:52.732 --> 00:23:56.182
Yeah, I see it now. Yeah, that's
300.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3055-0
00:23:59.492 --> 00:24:00.422
Are we still recording?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3059-0
00:24:00.992 --> 00:24:01.782
Yes, we are.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3067-0
00:24:03.152 --> 00:24:05.802
German does this help you with
your your work?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3076-0
00:24:09.112 --> 00:24:10.822
Malik and Hammad, if you guys.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3075-0
00:24:09.582 --> 00:24:10.632
Among malaise.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3088-0
00:24:11.892 --> 00:24:15.363
You guys need anything else?
Just tell me now. And are such

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3086-0
00:24:14.872 --> 00:24:15.312
Uh.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3088-1
00:24:15.363 --> 00:24:15.942
thing now.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3095-0
00:24:16.132 --> 00:24:16.802
Yes.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3098-0
00:24:18.692 --> 00:24:20.022
What the what Malik?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3111-0
00:24:19.802 --> 00:24:23.455
I think you you you covered
almost everything in your

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3105-0
00:24:21.282 --> 00:24:21.702
You could.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3111-1
00:24:23.455 --> 00:24:24.132
recording.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3151-0
00:24:25.352 --> 00:24:29.408
Outside these little steps up
here, I think it'd be cool to

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3151-1
00:24:29.408 --> 00:24:33.734
put an archway on them and maybe
something more along the edge.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3151-2
00:24:33.734 --> 00:24:37.790
And this doesn't have to be
brown. We can spray it off, put

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3151-3
00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:38.872
a coating on it.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3167-0
00:24:39.562 --> 00:24:43.193
There's a lot of little tiny
things. I also thought banking

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3167-1
00:24:43.193 --> 00:24:46.582
this having a wall all here
rigid with a cute concrete.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3172-0
00:24:47.992 --> 00:24:48.442
Yeah.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3193-0
00:24:48.052 --> 00:24:51.672
Just to make it look less
approachable, I don't want it to

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3193-1
00:24:51.672 --> 00:24:55.537
feel approachable. I could show
you some other properties that

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3193-2
00:24:55.537 --> 00:24:58.052
have that same vision I'm
talking about.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3197-0
00:24:58.952 --> 00:25:00.292
Yeah, that's right.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3209-0
00:25:02.352 --> 00:25:06.212
Alright. And that's all we need.
Give you plenty, huh?

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3203-0
00:25:03.742 --> 00:25:04.082
Really.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3205-0
00:25:04.082 --> 00:25:04.442
That's all.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3212-0
00:25:06.902 --> 00:25:07.192
Yep.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3226-0
00:25:07.772 --> 00:25:10.295
Now, Suzanne took a lot of
photos to you. I'll turn the

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3226-1
00:25:10.295 --> 00:25:11.962
video off. Let's stop the
recording.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3230-0
00:25:13.162 --> 00:25:13.472
OK.

478028cd-fe9c-4a36-88f0-d720dcb13f20/3239-0
00:25:13.192 --> 00:25:16.552
And Suzanne also just just now
took a ton of photos.
